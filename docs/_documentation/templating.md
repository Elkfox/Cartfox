In order to keep Cartfox as versatile as possible, we haven't included any cart rendering by default. However, we have made it painlessly simple to add rendering to your projects using only a few lines. Here are a few of our favorite implementaions using popular templating libraries:

### Handlebars
We have provided this Handlebars example in the `templating/` folder. This implementation has been pulled from our in-house framework [Concrete](https://elkfox.github.io/Concrete/).

{% highlight html %}
<script data-cart-template type="text/x-handlebars-template">

</script>
{% endhighlight %}

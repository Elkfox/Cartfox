==
A super simple implementation of the [Shopify](https://www.shopify.com) ajax cart API.

Light weight and easy to setup.

By [Elkfox](https://www.elkfox.com)


## Installation

Download the minified or uncompressed source files from the dist folder and add them to your themes asset folder.

If you don't have jQuery included inside your theme then we recommend using the cartfox.jquery.js or cartfox.jquery.min.js files. 
These include the jQuery libray for internal use so you don't have to.

Include the script in the head of your ``theme.liquid`` file using ``{% 'cartfox.js' | asset_url | script_tag %}``

## Initialization
Note: This is the bare minimum required to get Cartfox going.
~~~~js
 var cart = {{ cart | json }}
 var cartfox = new Cartfox.Cart(cart, {
   cart: '.cart',
   cartItemCount: '.cartItemCount',
   cartTotal: '.cartTotal',
   addItem: '.addItem',
   removeItem: '.removeItem',
 });
~~~~

### List of selectors
#### Required Selectors
* cart: The container for the ajax cart, if you have one.
* cartItemCount: The selector that displays the total number of items in the cart
* cartToal: The selector that displays the total value of the cart in $
* addItem: The selector for the 'Add To Cart' button usually found on your product pages
* removeItem: The selector for the 'Remove Item From Cart' button. 
(N.B. This button must also have a data attribute ``data-item-id`` that is set to the value of the item id.)

#### Optional Selectors
* emptyTemplate: The selector for your 'item template' in your cart popup or cart. Explained in the next section.
* itemsContainer: The selector for the container in your cart that holds all the items. Explained in the next section.
* decreaseQuantity: The selector for your "Reduce Quantity" button 
* increaseQuantity: The selector for your "Increase Quantity" button
* itemQuantity: The selector that contains the item quantity. This selector must also have a data-item-id data attribute set to the items data id for the increase and decrease buttons to work.

## jQuery events
A number of jQuery events are triggered whenever certain events are compelted.

| Event | Returns | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cartfox:requestStarted | ``None`` | Fires when the Queue has begun to be processed. |
| cartfox:requestFinished | ``None`` | Fires when the Queue has finished being processed. |
| cartfox:cannotAddToCart | ``string`` | Fires whenever the item cannot be added to the cart. Returns the error. |
| cartfox:requestError | ``string`` | Fires whenever a request inside the queue has failed. Returns the error. |
| cartfox:cartUpdated | ``object`` | Fires whenever the cart is updated. Returns the cart object. |



## Adding an empty template popup.
If you have a cart popup that appears everytime a customer adds an item to the cart then we recommend having what we call an 'empty cart template' set up ready to go. This is done by adding the ``emptyTemplate`` option to the initialisation method. You will also need to include the 'container' for the items in your cart. .e.g. ``#AjaxCart .items``
~~~~js
//code above
var cartfox = new Cartfox.Cart(cart, {
   ...other Cartfox selectors...,
   emptyTemplate: '#AjaxCart .hidden-item-template',
   itemsContainer: '#AjaxCart .items'
   });
~~~~
Now when``updateCart(cart)`` is called (By design whenever ``getCart()`` is called) Cartfox will select the empty template and copy it for each item it needs to add to the cart. If these are not set then 

## Ajax Cart quantity update.
If you'd like to have **+** or **-** buttons on either side of your item quantities in your ajax cart then you can include them on either side of your quantity span, paragaph, div, etc. Including the item id inside a data attribute on the quantity makes it easier for the **+** and **-** items to find the item id that they need to update the quantity for. 
~~~~html
<span class="decrease-qty">-</span><span class="item-qty" data-item-id="123121">12</span><span class="increase-qty">
~~~~

Don't forget to add these selectors to your cartfox initialisation function.

~~~~js
//Code above cart initilisation
var cartfox = new Cartfox.Cart(cart, { 
...other Cartfox selectors...,
decreaseQuantity: '.decrease-qty',
increaseQuantity: '.increase-qty',
item-quantity: '.item-qty',
});
~~~~
